# DivHacks: Columbia University Hackathon Fall 2024 

Step 1: Gather Data: 
---------------------
- Collect historical economic data such as unemployment rates, GDP, or any economic indicators that can represent growth and recession.
- You could use public datasets like unemployment rates, GDP, or inflation.
- Use Pandas to load the CSV or Excel file.


Step 2: Analyze Data:
---------------------

- Find the overall average of the data to determine what qualifies as "growth" or "recession."
- Mark years as either “Recession” or “Growth” based on this comparison.

Step 3: Visualizations 
---------------------
- Use Matplotlib or Plotly to generate graphs based on the data.


Team Work Overall:
--------
My team and I worked on finding the data sets the first day of the Hackthon.
However, due to shortcomings I went on to do the remaining steps (2 and 3) on my own such the  analyzation.
