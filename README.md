# DivHacks: Columbia University Hackathon Fall 2024 

Step 1: Gather Data: ✅
---------------------
- Collect historical economic data such as unemployment rates, GDP, or any economic indicators that can represent growth and recession.
- You could use public datasets like unemployment rates, GDP, or inflation.
- Use Pandas to load the CSV or Excel file.


Step 2: Analyze Data:✅
---------------------

- Find the overall average of the data to determine what qualifies as "growth" or "recession."
- Mark years as either “Recession” or “Growth” based on this comparison.

Step 3: Visualizations ✅
---------------------
- Use Matplotlib or Plotly to generate graphs based on the data.

Step 4: Train a Machine Learning Model
---------------------
- Advise: Use Scikit-learn to train a decision tree model using the economic data to predict whether future years will be in growth or recession.
- Goal: compare the models prediction to the anayzeData file. If there's match then both files are accurate. This is for cross-checking. 

Team Work Overall:
--------
My team and I worked on finding the data sets the first day of the hackerthon. However, due to shortcomings I went on to do the remaining steps on my own such the  analyzation, will complete the prediction model over spring 2025.
